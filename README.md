> Marketplace a blockchain based Decentralised apllication!

It is an online shopping marketplace that is run from a blockchain
with decentralized hosting rather than a single central authority.
Data is held on a set of decentralized computers or nodes and is
stored in blocks that are linked in sequence to form a chain.
Blockchains applications are in various sectors including supply
chains, business processes automation, etc. Developments in Blockchain
technology have enabled the creation of smart contracts; i.e.,
self-executing code that is stored and executed on the Blockchain.
This has led to the creation of distributed, decentralised
applications, along with frameworks for developing and deploying them
easily. This application describes a proof-of-concept system that
implements a distributed online marketplace using the Ethereum
framework, where buyers and sellers can engage in e-commerce
transactions without the need of a large central entity coordinating
the process.Seller can List thier items easily and buyer can purchase
it.
